Hi here, welcome to my personal website! Taken my advisor's suggestion, I intend to seek for desired post-doc position 1-year early. Don't worry, it is not now. I am acutally around half year or almost 1 year away from my **1-year early** mark.

In the meantime, I want to slowly build up my CV or protfolio to integrate the research and ~~mostly~~ non-research projects I have been working on. It will be a good way to show my scattered skills. Here you go, this site is born. I will update it from time to time. If I encountered you through my academic path, you might see your name on here **someday** (may be very far away from now though...)

Enjoy!
