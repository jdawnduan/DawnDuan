### *To be updated from time to time* ❤

Check back later. You may see your name! and maybe some histories (from my perspective)

I cannot have merely professional encounters to be successful in my professional career, therefore, some people listed here might not have helped me with my work related to chemistry, but the emotional support and the nuance help that I received is extremely valuable. Every little bit counts.

Like if I want to cross the desert, I need **WATER & food** for sure, but I also need encouragement along the way. In this list is my WATER & food, and my encouragements.

*[This list will eventually be sorted in another way, but for now, it will be in a random order]*

## Undergraduate Stage
- **Dr. Camille Malonzo May** : my 1st ever mentor : too many to say so a short paragraph or a long list is in preparation
- **Prof. Andreas Stein** : 1st ever PI : too many to say so a short paragraph or a long list is in preparation
- **Dr. Emily Pelton** : 1st chemistry professor in the US, helped me succeed and adopt to chemistry classes in the US, in addition, I started working as a group leader for two semesters for Emily's classes
- **Dr. Debra (Janie) Salmon** : wonderful lectures; 1st time worked for Janie as a TA for an advanced inorganic lab
- **Prof. Michelle Driessen** : wonderful lab course director; worked for Michelle as a TA for many semesters
- **Prof. Connie Lu** : wonderful inorganic professor; Thank Connie for helping me succeed on inorganic class and helped me to acquire experience as a inorganic TA; also helped me during grad school applications
- **Prof. Aaron Massari** : wonderful physical chemical professor; thank all the discussions we had related to the class and related to grad school applications
- **Prof. John Ellis** : wonderful organometallic professor sparked my interest to chemistry once more with his spectacular demos and sense of humor in addition to his knowledge on chemical reactions (I cannot forget seeing him actively operating glovebox in the lab and I would like to be someone like that when I have my own lab)
- **Prof. Lee Penn** : although we never encounter each other officially, thank Prof. Penn for delivering the lecture on microscopy (used a popcorn as an example) thank Prof. Penn for coordinating the ACS travel grant
- <a href = 'https://www.weiyanc.com/home' target='_blank'>**Prof. Weiyan Chen**</a> : wonderful math professor, helped my have a better understanding in group theory from the math aspects (finished a LaTex report about Galois Theory)
- **Dr. Yan Wang** my 1st every lab TA, also introduced the concept Metal-organic framework (a type of material I then worked with for 6 years until now) to me and helped me with finding my 1st lab
- **Dr. Siyao He** : awesome graduate student in the Stein group and helped my fit in the lab, obtained useful discussions on my studies, also being a wonderful friend of life
- **Yali Zhang** : awesome roommate I had and being very supportive. Thank yali for many conversations over studies and life.
- **Yukun Cheng** : wonderful classmates and friend, helping me understand organometallic subjects
- **Jon Schltz** : excellent lab-mate in our inorganic lab, great friend from undergraduate to graduate study, helped me process my statements during graduate school application and also helped me review my documents for other applications in grad school. (A short paragraph or a long list is in queue)

## Graduate School Stage
### Things are changing so quickly so this list will be constantly updating and modifying
- **Prof. Joseph T. Hupp** : to be added
- **Prof. Chung-wei Kung** : great conversation during lunch regarding the life in the group and doing reearch on electrochemistry
- **Dr. Goswami** : helped me get use to the group and in transitioning to graduate studies, demonstrated how to conduct experiments, write manuscripts, process data, and so on. My 2nd mentor.
- **Dr. Mansu Kim** : My 3rd mentor, details to be added.
- **Dr. Xuan Zhang** : useful conversations in measuring and solving single crystal structures of MOFs
- **Jon Schltz** : great support and motivator, helped me with electrochemistry demo and reviewed my documents
- **Dr. Hyunho Noh** : useful conversations about experiments and group business
- **Prof. Ken-ichi Otake** : sparked my interest in crystallography
- **Dr. Rebecca Palmer** : strong support in the group and motivated me to train for my 1st ever 5K run, in addition, we had many great discussions on research and graduate life, too
