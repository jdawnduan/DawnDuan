This project is what you are seeing right now. ฅʕ•̫͡•ʔฅ
You can find the source <a href = 'https://github.com/jdawnduan/DawnDuan'>
**HERE** </a>.

Hi here, welcome to my personal website! Taken my advisor's suggestion, I intend to seek for desired post-doc position 1-year early. Don't worry, it is not now. I am acutally around half year or almost 1 year away from my 1-year early mark.

In the meantime, I want to slowly build up my CV or protfolio to integrate the research and mostly non-research projects I have been working on. It will be a good way to show my scattered skills. Here you go, this site is born. I will update it from time to time. If I encountered you through my academic path, you might see your name on here someday (may be very far away from now though...)

Enjoy!
