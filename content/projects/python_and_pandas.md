In developing an automated workflow on processing and plot data for subgroup meetings. I have a couple of them pushed to my **_ugly_** GitHub page. If you are curious, you can take a look at them <a href = 'https://github.com/jdawnduan/Data_plot_collaborate'>
**HERE**</a>. I have a couple sample data there, feel free to roast my codes or contribute, if you'd like to spend some time on it. ‚ù§

Below is the image that motivate me to make some auto-plot projects. You can read more from <a href = 'https://xkcd.com/1205/'>

  <figcaption>Title text: Don't forget the time you spend finding the chart to look up what you save. And the time spent reading this reminder about the time spent. And the time trying to figure out if either of those actually make sense. Remember, every second counts toward your life total, including these right now.</figcaption>
